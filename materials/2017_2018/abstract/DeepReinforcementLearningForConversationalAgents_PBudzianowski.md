# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Conversational Agents
## by Paweł Budzianowski

### Bio
Paweł Budzianowski received his B.A. and M.A. degrees from the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan in 2015. Since then he has been at the University of Cambridge first as an MPhil student reading Machine Learning. Afterwards, he has begun a PhD in the Dialogue Systems Group at the University of Cambridge. His research interests include multi-domain policy management and Bayesian deep learning
 
### Abstract
In spoken dialogue systems, we aim at building automated dialogue agents that can converse with humans. A part of this effort is the policy optimization task, which attempts to find a policy guiding the conversation. This talk will give a gentle introduction to data-driven dialogue systems and address some challenges in training dialogue management module via deep reinforcement learning - namely sample efficiency and stability of learning. We will discuss whether Bayesian approaches can improve stability and efficiency of value-based methods.
